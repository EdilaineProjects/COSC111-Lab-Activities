Objectives:
1. Discuss analog signals and its implementation in a Arduino circuit.
2. Understand analog to digital signal conversion using the map() function.

Instructions:
1. Building on the 1st activity. Create the same logic, but applying the following condition:
- Use pins 8 to 12 for the LEDs
- Running light from 12 to 8 with a delay of 1 second (turn all LED on one by one, then turn all LED off one by one)
- use analogWrite() to control the brightness of LEDs
- implement using while() loop and an array to set the pin modes
