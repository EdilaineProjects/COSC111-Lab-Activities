Laboratory #3: Working with Sensors

## Objectives:
- Integrate these sensor components in an Arduino circuit
- The objective of this project is to create a fire detection system using a temperature sensor and a photoresistor. The system monitors the temperature and brightness levels, and if both exceed predefined thresholds, it triggers an alert by blinking an LED.
  
## Instructions:
- Using a NTC thermistor. Each thermistor has a normal resistance. In our case, it should be 10k ohms, which is measured under 25 degrees Celsius.

## Sensors to be used in this activity
- Potentiometer
- Thermistor
- Photoresistor

How to Run
1. Connect the temperature sensor, photoresistor, and LED to the specified pins on your microcontroller.
2. Upload the code to your microcontroller.
3. Open the serial monitor to view the temperature and brightness readings.
4. The LED will blink if both the temperature and brightness exceed their respective thresholds, indicating a potential fire.
