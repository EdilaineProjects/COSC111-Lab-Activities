Laboratory #3: Working with Sensors

## Objectives:
- Integrate these sensor components in an Arduino circuit

## Instructions:
- Using a NTC thermistor. Each thermistor has a normal resistance. In our case, it should be 10k ohms, which is measured under 25 degrees Celsius.

## Sensors to be used in this activity
- Potentiometer
- Thermistor
- Photoresistor
