Laboratory Activity #4: Serial Connection

## Objective: 
- The objective of this project is to create a light detection system using a photoresistor and an LED. The system monitors the brightness level and triggers the LED to blink if the brightness exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Description: 
- Photoresistor (PHOTO_SENSOR_PIN): Measures the ambient light level.
- LED (LED_PIN): Acts as an alert indicator.
- Brightness Threshold (BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD): The maximum brightness level for triggering the LED.

## Instructions: 
1.  Connect the photoresistor and LED to the specified pins on your microcontroller.
2.  Upload the code to your microcontroller.
3.  Open the serial monitor to view the brightness readings and status.
4.  The LED will blink if the brightness exceeds the threshold. You can stop the blinking by sending the command "stop" via the serial monitor.
